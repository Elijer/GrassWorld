# GrassWorld
I want to create a survival game that combines RTS, FPS and environmental simulation elements in a relatively mutable open, natural world with some fantasy elements.

### WARNING
As it is right now, there's just an endless amount of grass being generated, one per frame so...probably don't leave it on for TOO long after pressing play or it might crash.

### Note
I imported assets included from this Brackeys tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8&t=560s
Those assets can be found here: https://github.com/Brackeys/NavMesh-Tutorial
These assets are for NavMesh functionality, and have been imported into this project.

### Controls
C - switch Camera
Mouse - look around
