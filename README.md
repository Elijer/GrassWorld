# GrassWorld
I want to create a survival game that combines RTS, FPS and environmental simulation elements in a relatively mutable open, natural world with some fantasy elements.

### Note
I imported assets included from this Brackeys tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8&t=560s
Those assets can be found here: https://github.com/Brackeys/NavMesh-Tutorial
These assets are for NavMesh functionality, and have been imported into this project.

### Controls
Select Camera: 1, 2, 3
Eat Grass: hold space
Look around: Press 1, click with mouse, move mouse
Direct Character: Press 2, click somewhere on ground
Center View: Press 2, click "c"

### Play
A build for Mac is in the Builds folder
